# I HATE REACT NATIVE

bro react native too complicated as hell, tbh the mockup is the only thing done, other tabs are actually empty.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## Mockup Of App
<table>
  <tr>
    <td style="padding-right: 24px;">
      <img src="mockups/2.png" width="300"/>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="mockups/1.png" width="300"/>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
